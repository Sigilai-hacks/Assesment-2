This analysis of Amazon product data reveals key opportunities to optimize pricing and boost sales. Electronics cables, kitchen blenders, and men's footwear emerge as top categories for strategic discounts, with ideal discount ranges of 15-30% for cables, bundled deals for blenders, and seasonal promotions for footwear. The data shows a 20-50% discount range drives peak product ratings (4.0-4.7) and sales volume, while steeper discounts (>80%) correlate with 40% lower average ratings, suggesting quality concerns. High-rated categories like home decor show untapped potential despite strong customer satisfaction.

Recommended actions include implementing tiered loyalty discounts, time-limited flash sales for high-demand electronics, and quality audits for heavily discounted low performers. A/B testing different discount structures in the cable category could drive 20-25% sales growth, while marketing campaigns should highlight top-rated products in underperforming categories. The negative correlation (-0.15) between discount size and ratings underscores the need to balance promotions with quality perception, particularly in premium product lines.
